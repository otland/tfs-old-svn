[ Milestone
	Protocol 8.62 support.
	Fixed a bug with the reading of banishment comment.
	Rewritten the way the amount of frags are calculated as an attempt to make it more accurate, and removed the formatTime function from tools.
	The "Loot of" message will no longer list containers that aren't empty.
	Removed the trailing dot from the "Loot of" message.
	Changes to the movement code to make map-clicking smoother.
	Players can no longer heal paralyze during movement, it will instead be healed once the player finishes his/her current move.
	Fixed a bug with player saving.
	Added a new way to save house items: binary-tilebased, a safer way. In case of stream failure, it will just wipe the tiles it fails at instead of entire houses.
	Fixed a lot of Lua binding errors, and added support for LuaJIT (compile with -D__LUAJIT__ to use LuaJIT).
	Experience will no longer be shared in a party when the victim is a player.
	Players will no longer receive an unjustified kills for killing guild mates.
	Corrected a disconnect message in gameworld connection.
	Added missing disconnect message when auth fails in gameworld connection.
	Fixed possible shop system exploit.
	Status protocol compatibility.
	New configurable variable (removeChargesFromWeapons, default: "yes").
	Removed Rule Violation Reports channel (Ctrl + R) as it no longer exists in protocol 8.62.
	Removed protocol code for Rule Violation Window (Ctrl + Y) as it no longer exists in protocol 8.62.
	A command to ban has been added: /ban playername, action (1-x, or strin, i.e "Ban"), reason (1-21, or string, i.e "Multi-clienting"), ipbanishment (1 or 0), comment. It uses the Rule Violation Window code, so days etc. are still configured in config.lua.
	Fixed so that there won't be any kind of issues with a player named Account Manager when the ingame account manager code is disabled.
	Replaced items.xml and items.otb with the ones from OpenTibia and fixed compatibility stuff.
	Further support for OpenTibia items.xml format: absorbPercentAllElements, femaleSleeper, maleSleeper.
	Access players will now speak in orange by default in channels.
	Fixed a memory leak with LuaSQL.
	A lot of miscellaneous cleanups, formating, improvements and fixes.
